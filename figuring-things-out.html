        <h1>Figuring Things Out</h1>

        <p>I’ve always been more interested in how things work than in making them work perfectly. Engineering, to me,
            is a way of understanding — taking something apart, figuring out the logic behind it, and putting it back
            together with a little more clarity each time.</p>

        <p>Right now, I’m learning the fundamentals: circuits, control, materials, and motion. It’s humbling how much
            there is to learn, but that’s what keeps it exciting. Every new concept connects to something I’ve seen
            before — a pattern, a behavior, or a system that suddenly clicks.</p>

        <p>My curiosity doesn’t stay in one lane. Biology taught me how nature builds self-correcting systems. AI showed
            me how machines learn through failure. Robotics feels like the bridge between them — where software and
            hardware meet to create motion that makes sense.</p>

        <p>I don’t see technology as something to master, but as something to explore. It changes faster than anyone can
            keep up with, but the underlying questions stay the same: how can we make things more efficient, more
            reliable, and a little more human?</p>

        <p>That’s what keeps me learning — not the end result, but the process of figuring it out piece by piece.</p>
