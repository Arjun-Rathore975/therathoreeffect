        <div class="project-card">
            <h3>AI Drone for Potato Blight Detection</h3>
            <p>Collaborated with a few classmates to develop a drone-based system capable of detecting early stages of potato blight using image-based AI
                classification. Integrated trained models to identify symptoms across farmland plots and tested
                detection accuracy under variable light and soil conditions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-card">
            <h3>Myelin Foundry — Deep Learning for Satellite Imagery</h3>
            <p>Worked on visualising and classifying satellite images through deep-learning architectures including
                YOLO, UNet, and ResNet. Focused on cloud removal, segmentation, and clustering techniques to analyse
                terrain. Learned practical data cleaning, training, and experimentation workflows.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-card">
            <h3>National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) — Regeneration in Planarian Flatworms</h3>
            <p>Studied cellular regeneration by slicing planarian flatworms along different axes and examining their
                recovery patterns. Researched how positional cues and signal gradients drive tissue reconstruction. The
                work led to a publication analysing regeneration mechanisms.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-card">
            <h3>Internship at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) </h3>
            <p>Gained hands-on exposure to molecular biology, cell culture, and bioimaging processes at IISc,
                along with practical observation experiences.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-card">
            <h3>Community Projects</h3>
            <p>Founded Weekend Warriors, a community effort supporting local families during the pandemic. Conducted
                volunteer tutoring and STEM workshops in public schools. Helped one student secure a national
                scholarship through personalised academic support.</p>
