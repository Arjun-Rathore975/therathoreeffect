        <h1>Hi, I’m Arjun Rathore.</h1>
        <p>I’m studying mechatronics engineering at the University of Sydney, learning how machines sense, think, and
            act. I’m interested in how mechanical systems and intelligent algorithms come together to solve real
            problems.</p>
        <p>Building an AI drone to detect crop disease taught me that good engineering starts with understanding the
            problem, not chasing complexity. Researching regeneration in planarian flatworms at INSTEM showed me that
            biology and engineering share the same logic—feedback, iteration, and resilience. Working on deep-learning
            models for satellite imagery at Myelin Foundry helped me appreciate the art of data science —
            learning how to bring order to imperfect data.</p>
        <p>These projects shaped how I approach technology—as an iterative process grounded in clarity and purpose. I’m
            currently exploring how robotics and AI can bridge software and hardware through efficient, human-centered
            design.</p>
        <p>Outside academics, I play football as a goalkeeper, perform drums at live events, and read about innovators who built
            lasting systems from first principles. Whether it’s music, sport, or robotics, I’ve learned that timing,
            rhythm, and structure drive everything that works well.</p>
